# Spaghetti Aglio e Olio

A classic Italian pasta dish from Naples. Simple, fast, and delicious.

---

Bring a large pot of salted @water{4%liters} to a boil. Add @spaghetti{400%g} and cook until al dente according to package directions. Reserve @pasta water{1%cup} before draining.

While pasta cooks, slice @garlic{6%cloves} very thinly. You want paper-thin slices for even cooking.

Heat @extra virgin olive oil{1/2%cup} in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the sliced garlic and @red pepper flakes{1/2%tsp}. Cook gently for ~{2-3%minutes}, stirring frequently, until garlic is golden but not brown.

Add drained pasta to the skillet along with @fresh parsley{1/4%cup, chopped}. Toss to combine, adding reserved pasta water as needed to create a light sauce.

Season with @salt{} and @black pepper{} to taste. Serve immediately with @parmesan cheese{} on the side.

## Notes

- Don't let the garlic brown or it will become bitter
- The pasta water's starch helps emulsify the oil into a sauce
- Use good quality olive oil - you'll taste it
- Can add anchovies or capers for variation
