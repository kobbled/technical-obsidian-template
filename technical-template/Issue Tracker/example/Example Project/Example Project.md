[[Issues - Example Project|Issues]] [[Kanban - Example Project|Kanban]]

This is an example project for [[Issue Tracker/README|Obsidian Issue Tracker]].

If you have installed [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), it would also be great to link it here.

This project follows the file structure implied by the script:

```
Project Name
├── issues
│   ├── issue-1.md
│   ├── ...
│   └── issue-n.md
├── Issues - Project Name.md
└── Project Name.md
```

Where the name of the project note (this note) and project folder is identical to the name of the project.

## Project Goal

Provide an example for users to better understand how the script is used.
