## Abstract

Special coatings protect components against corrosion and wear. However, standard processes such as hard chrome plating, thermal spraying, laser material deposition or other deposition welding techniques have drawbacks. For example, as of September 2017, chromium(VI) coatings will require authorization. Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology ILT in Aachen as well as the RWTH Aachen University have now developed an extreme high-speed laser material deposition process, known by its German acronym EHLA, to eliminate these drawbacks in an economical way.

> "_EHLA increases the feed rate from 0.5 to 2 meters per minute to between 50 and 500 meters per minute, thus coating a component 100 to 250 times faster than before_"

> "_EHLA allows for layers that measure just 25 to 250 micrometers_"

> "_EHLA uses the laser beam to melt the powder particles while they are still above the melt pool. Since drops of liquid material fall into the melt pool instead of solid powder particles, less material must be melted â€“ a few micrometers suffice instead of hundreds of micrometers_"

> "_Using EHLA shrinks the heat-affected zone by a factor of one hundred: from between 500 and 1000 micrometers in conventional laser material deposition down to just 5 to 10 micrometers._"

> "_If the layer is to be defect-free, the powder particles must melt completely. This requires a relatively large melt pool, which requires a lot of energy and high heat input_"

> "_With EHLA, on the other hand, the laser melts the powder particles while they are still above the melt pool (Fig.Â 3). Since the powder particles no longer need to be melted in the melt pool, the processing speed of 0.5 to 2 meters per minute can be increased by orders of magnitudes to 500 meters per minute despite minimal heating_"

> "_This new process can also be used for entirely new material combinations, such as coatings on aluminum base alloys or cast iron._"

> "_the worldwide market for hard chrome plating was estimated at_"
		> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX4J8NAF?page=4&annotation=LSVLCMUP)

	
> "_13.64Â billion dollars, while the market for thermal spraying amounted to 7.56 billion dollars._"
